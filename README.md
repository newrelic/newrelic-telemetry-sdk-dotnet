# New Relic Telemetry SDK and OpenTelemetry support for .NET

[![Build status](https://dev.azure.com/NRAzurePipelines/dotnet/_apis/build/status/newrelic.newrelic-telemetry-sdk-dotnet?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/NRAzurePipelines/dotnet/_build/latest?definitionId=17&branchName=master)

This repo contains the New Relic Telemetry SDK and an OpenTelemetry provider for .NET.

## [New Relic OpenTelemetry trace exporter](/src/OpenTelemetry.Exporter.NewRelic)
[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) is a set of APIs that aim to standardize the collection and reporting of application telemetry information.  The [New Relic trace exporter for OpenTelemetry](/src/OpenTelemetry.Exporter.NewRelic) allows tracing information collected within the OpenTelemetry framework to be reported to New Relic.  This exporter is built using New Relic's Telemetry SDK.

## [New Relic Telemetry SDK](/src/NewRelic.Telemetry)
The [New Relic Telemetry SDK](/src/NewRelic.Telemetry) allows tracking of information about the execution of an application and sends it to the New Relic back-end.  New Relic tools allow the visualization of this information, making it insightful and actionable.

## Limitations
The New Relic Telemetry APIs are rate limited. Please reference the [documentation](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-telemetry-sdk-specs) for New Relic Metric API and Trace API requirements and limits on the specifics of the rate limits.
