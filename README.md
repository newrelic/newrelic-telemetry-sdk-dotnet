Rather than developing a .NET specific OpenTelemetry exporter New Relic has adopted a language agnostic approach that facilitates data collection from all OpenTelemetry data sources.

The current recommended approaches for sending OpenTelemetry data to the New Relic platform are as follows:

* Configure your OpenTelemetry data source to send data to the [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/introduction-opentelemetry-new-relic/#collector) using the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) and configure the collector to forward the data using the [New Relic collector exporter](https://github.com/newrelic-forks/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/newrelic-main/exporter/newrelicexporter).
* Configure your OpenTelemetry data source to send data to the native OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) data ingestion endpoint. [OTLP](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/otlp.md) is an open source gRPC based protocol for sending telemetry data. The protocol is vendor agnostic and open source.

# New Relic .NET Telemetry SDK

![New Relic .NET Telemetry SDK](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-telemetry-sdk-dotnet/workflows/New%20Relic%20Telemetry%20SDK%20for%20.NET/badge.svg?branch=main)

The [New Relic .NET Telemetry SDK](/src/NewRelic.Telemetry) allows tracking of information about the execution of an application and sends it to the New Relic back-end.  New Relic tools allow the visualization of this information, making it insightful and actionable.

## Limitations
The New Relic Telemetry APIs are rate limited. Please reference the [documentation](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-telemetry-sdk-specs) for New Relic Metric API and Trace API requirements and limits on the specifics of the rate limits.

## Find and use your data

Tips on how to find and query your data in New Relic:
- [Find metric data](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-ingest-apis/get-data-new-relic/metric-api/introduction-metric-api#find-data)
- [Find trace/span data](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/understand-dependencies/distributed-tracing/trace-api/introduction-trace-api#view-data)

For general querying information, see:
